<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Local Windows 11 Home Version 21H2</b>
- Windows 10 Pro version 22H2 Virtual Machine
  
<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Subscription
- Microsoft Azure Subscription Credit 

<h2>Installation, Setup, Resource Setup, Executing Functions</h2>

1. After successfully installing osTicket, below we can see our Agent/Admin Panel on the left and the User Panel on the right. The Agent and Admin Panels are used by the organisation internally to configure the Helpdesk structure, communicate and work through tickets. The "Support Center" or User Panel is used by the end user (whether this is an end-user as a customer or an internal department user) to create a support request and communicate with the agent dealing with their request.

2. Within the Admin Panel, I configured permissions for the Main Admin in the Admin Panel. This allows this specific Agent to undertake the chosen tasks in the image. An Admin User who has access to this section can choose what permissions to give a certain Agent, depending on different factors such as their department, or position within the company.

<p>
6. In this section I configured the settings to not have to allow End-Users to register in order to create a ticket. This would be ideal as it would allow customers and end-users to easily request support with little friction or having to create an account.
